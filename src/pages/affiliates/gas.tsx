              <span className="mt-4 block text-2xl font-bold">Our Projects</span>
              <br />
              Obama gas flare commercialization project: We are constructing a
              20 mmscfd mini-LNG facility in Okoroma Bayelsea state. The
              feedstock for the gas is from the Obama Flowstation operated by
              the NAOC JV evidenced by the execution of a gas sales and purchase
              agreement between the NAOC JV and Alphaden, which shows our
              contribution towards a safe and cleaner environment. The facility
              will cater to up to 5 days site storage for all products and the
              same amount of off-site storage. The products will be transported
              to the offsite storage facility via self-propelled barges and will
              be transported to the customer site regasification stations via
              purpose-fit distribution trucks. The trucks will be able to
              transport up to 20MT per load, enough to generate up to 120,000kwh
              of electricity. Tebidaba gas flare commercialization project: Upon
              the recent completion of the Nigerian Gas Flare Commercialization
              program, we were awarded the rights to commercialize the gas from
              the tebidaba Flowstation. We are currently finalizing with
              investors the capital required to develop the project.
